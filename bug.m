This code attempts to access an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  In Objective-C, this will lead to an unexpected behavior or crash.  The specific issue is the use of `[myArray objectAtIndex:index]` without sufficient checking of the `index` value against the array's bounds. If `index` is greater than or equal to `[myArray count]` or less than 0, it will result in an error.
