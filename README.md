# Objective-C Array Index Out-of-Bounds Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Objective-C: accessing an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior in your application.

The `bug.m` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version with proper bounds checking.

**Key Learning:** Always validate array indices before accessing elements to prevent crashes and ensure robust code.
